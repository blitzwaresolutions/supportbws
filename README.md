About This Mission ☕

At BlitzWare Solutions, we’re putting traditional jobs on hold to build life-saving tech that actually works when it matters most. We're developing BlitzWeather AI, a next-gen early warning system designed to detect severe weather threats—faster than the National Weather Service and way before the sirens (if they even sound at all).

Your cup of coffee funds critical upgrades, cloud infrastructure, field testing, and real-time alert systems—bringing faster warnings to people everywhere, not just the flood zones.

Support now. Help us beat the storm.

Because next time, "there was no warning" shouldn't be the last thing someone says.
