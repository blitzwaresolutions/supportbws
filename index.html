      <h1>SUPPORT THE MISSION ☕️</h1>

      <p>At BlitzWare Solutions, we’re building life-saving tech that actually works when it matters most. We're developing BlitzWeather AI, a next-generation early warning system designed to work in tandem and  independently to detect severe weather threats—faster than the National Weather Service and way before the sirens (if they even sound at all).</p>

      <p>Your cup of coffee funds critical upgrades, cloud infrastructure, field testing, and real-time alert systems—bringing faster warnings to people everywhere, not just the flood zones.</p>

      <p>But we can't do it alone. We don't have corporate sponsors, stockholders or million dollar finance streams. We walked away from traditional jobs because we felt we had seen enough and could make a difference. To make a safer future from the unwarned disasters striking communities across the globe that are rapidly increasing. Infrastructure based on decades old technologies and government funded programs recently cut, are failing the people who's lives rely on them around the globe.</p>

<p>BlitzWeather AI is more the just another weather app. It's also an off-grid swiss Army knife you can use when SHTF. It's the only weather app that's <i>built by survivors, for survivors.</i></p>

<p>Help us beat the storm.</p>

      <p>Because next time, <i>"there was no warning" </i>shouldn't be the last thing someone says.</p>
